Object Relational Impedance mismatch

Java implements object model

RDBMS implements relational model--tables

Granularity mismatch:

Object model is more granular than Relational  model.

SubType(Inheritance mismatch)

Object model has hierarchy of objects but there is no such thing in Relational model

Identity mismatch

In object model, two objects are said to be same if both has same object reference.
In relational model, two rows are same if their primary keys are equal.

Association mismatch
In object model it is done using object refernces, In relational model, it is done using foreign key.

Data Navigation
In object model, we walk thru object graph using object references, In relational model, we use join queries.
